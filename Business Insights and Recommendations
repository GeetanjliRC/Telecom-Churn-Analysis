Telecom industry is a highly competitive market with multiple service providers where customers can actively switch from one operator to another resulting in a high churn rate. Here customer retention becomes more important than customer acquisition for a profitable business. In this project we performed EDA on the given Telecom dataset to discover key factors responsible for customer churn and recommend business strategies to ensure customer retention.

After performing the eda, we got to know that 483 customers churned out of 3333 total customers. Insights driven from the analysis are as follows:-

Churn rate is more than 21% for states NJ, CA, TX, MD, SC and MI probably due to low network coverage.

Account length doesn't have any direct connection to churn rate but as majority of customers lies in range 70-120 days, churn rate is also high for the respective no of days.

Area code 415 has highest no of churned customers but area code 510 has highest churn rate i.e 14.9%.

Churn rate for customers with International plan is 42.4% due to high call charge.

Out of 922 voice mail plan users, 8.6% customers churned. Customers with more than 20 voice-mail messages are more likely to churn that means that the quality of voice mail is not good.

Customers making 4 or more customer service calls have churn rate more than 45% which means service centers couldn't resolve unsatisfied customer's issues.

As per call charges and minutes, we can infer that customers with more day call minutes have high charges and are more likely to churn therfore some discount to high value customers should be given.
